### Code within ./


The 'datasets.py' file contains a helper function, get_bank_data, to load the bank data and convert numerical features to binary features (using the media) given the file paths to the train/test csv files. 

The code for hw 1, i.e. the ID3 code and associated helper functions pre ensemble learning, exists in 'decision_tree_fns.py.' The tree_maker function in this file was updated to accomodate random forests such that it takes a new argument, attr_subset_len, which is the number that decides how many features we randomly subsample and consider in deciding the next split. 



### Code within ./perceptron

There is a jupyter notebook called 'perceptron.ipynb' that runs the experiments, and I converted it to a python script with an associated 'run.sh' file. This prints the train and test accuracies for the bank-note dataset with a standard perceptron, a voted perceptron and an averaged perceptron implementation. 

There is also a notebook 'paper_problems.ipynb,' which I used to calculate margins and help with getting answers for some of the paper problems, saving some of the figures as well.

### Code within ./linear_regression


There is a jupyter notebook called 'linear_regression.ipynb' that runs the experiments, and I converted it to a python script with an associated 'run.sh' file. The convergence plots for batch GD and stochastic GD are saved as 'batch_gradient_descent_loss_curve.png' and 'stochastic_gradient_descent_loss_curve.png' respectively. 



### Code within ./emsemble_learning

Within the ensemble learning directory, I saved the forests I made in directories that correspond to the problem they were made for, i.e. 2a,2b,2c,2d,2e. The forests were saved as python pkl files, which are large and so I won't upload them to github. I realize that I should've probably saved them as text files and read them as jsons or something, but alas. 

The code for the experiments of problem 2 in the homework exists in ensemble_learning.ipynb. Of course, you probably won't want to remake the trees because it takes a long while, so I made a separate text file that prints when you run the run.sh file to show some of the results. Any of the *.png files are the figures from the experiments and are named relative to the problem they're associated with. 

Code for the bonus dataset in problem 3 exists in 3_bonus_credit_card.ipynb.


The file 'ensemble_fns.py' contains the functions / helper functions to create adaboost, bagged forests and random forests. Here are explanations of the main function declarations: 

############################################################################################################
#### random_forest(X,y,feat_names,tree_count=10, max_depth=10, IG_metric='entropy', attr_subset_len=2)

This function returns a random forest as a python list of 'tree_count' trees all which have a 'max_depth'
and whose split decisions were made using 'IG_metric' (one of 'gini' 'entropy' or 'me' (majority error). As previously mentioned, 'attr_subset_len' is the number that decides how many features we randomly subsample and consider in deciding the each split. 

X should be a numpy array w/ dimensions as (num_examples, num_features)
y should be a numpy array w/ dimensions as (num_examples,1)
feat_names should be a list of strings of the feature names in an order that corresponds correctly with the columns of X. 

For the bank data, this is: feat_names = np.array(['age', 'job', 'marital', 'education', 'default', 'balance',
       'housing', 'loan', 'contact', 'day_of_week', 'month', 'duration',
       'campaign', 'pdays', 'previous', 'poutcome'], dtype='<U11')


##### forest_pred(ex, forest, feat_names)

Takes in an example, a forest, and the feat_names of the data, and returns a prediction that is the
mode of the predictions across each tree in the forest. 

##### forest_acc(X,y,forest,feat_names)

This function returns the accuracy of our forest ensemble across the input dataset.

Note: Both forest_pred & forest_acc can be used on bagging forests. 

############################################################################################################
#### bagging(X,y,feat_names,tree_count=10, max_depth=10, IG_metric='entropy')
This function returns a bagging forest as a python list of 'tree_count' trees all which have a 'max_depth'
and whose split decisions were made using 'IG_metric' (one of 'gini' 'entropy' or 'me' (majority error).

X should be a numpy array w/ dimensions as (num_examples, num_features)
y should be a numpy array w/ dimensions as (num_examples,1)
feat_names should be a list of strings of the feature names in an order that corresponds correctly with the columns of X. 


############################################################################################################

#### adaboost(X,y,feat_names, num_stumps=100, IG_metric='entropy')
This function returns an adaboost ensemble with 'num_stumps,' whose split decisions were made using 'IG_metric' (one of 'gini' 'entropy' or 'me' (majority error). 
It also returns an array 'amount_of_says' that is of dimensions (num_stumps,) which corresponds to the amount of say of each stump. 
The ith index of stumps corresponds with the ith index of 
amount_of_says. 

X should be a numpy array w/ dimensions as (num_examples, num_features)
y should be a numpy array w/ dimensions as (num_examples,1)
feat_names should be a list of strings of the feature names in an order that corresponds correctly with the columns of X. 

##### adaboost_pred(ex, stumps, feat_names, amount_of_says)
This function takes in an example, i.e. X[0], the feat_names, as well as all the stumps/amount_of_says array output from adaboost, and makes a prediction by

1) summing over the amount_of_says for all the stumps that make the same prediction for the example
2) choosing the prediction value which corresponds to the highest of these sums

##### adaboost_acc(X,y,stumps,feat_names, amount_of_says)

This function returns the accuracy of our adaboost stump ensemble across the input dataset.

The run.sh file prints the results for these experiments, but doesn't run the tree learning as it is quite a timely process
